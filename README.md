# Ticker Logos (Stocks, Cryptocurrencies, & Forex)
Includes transparent and light/white version logos for (almost) all NYSE and NASDAQ stock companies, major cryptocurrencies, alt & memecoins, along with cropped country flags used to auto-generate forex ticker icons. Regularly updated to include missing or improved logos.

These are not all stock images; many have been customized, such as cropping icons from logos or changing dark fonts to white.

To better suit NVSTly's default dark theme UI, dark logos have been modified to appear in white or light colors, and backgrounds have been made transparent where necessary. These transparency adjustments may result in rough edges on some logos. Additionally, small logos or icons that were cropped and enlarged to 250x250 may have experienced some loss in quality.

# Stock Companies (NYSE, NASDAQ, OTC, & more)
This collection aims to include logos for all NYSE and NASDAQ-listed stock companies, as well as OTC market companies and other major stock exchanges. Most logos are sized at 250x250 pixels.

# Forex
Includes logos for all major country flags, with flags cropped from the center (except for flags like AUD and NZD, which have been adjusted for better distinction).

# Cryptocurrencies
Includes logos for all major cryptocurrencies, along with many altcoins and meme coins. Most logos are sized at 250x250 pixels.

Many logos with circle or coin backgrounds have been replaced with just the logo itself on a transparent background. (Still many to do.)

# Cryptocurrency Exchanges
Includes logos for all major cryptocurrency exchanges integrated with NVSTly. Regularly updated as exchanges are added or removed due to closure or discontinuation.

# TO DO
- Re-crop country flags in `forex_icons` so that all are the same size. (500x500 or 350x350 TBD)
- Replace all logos with non-transparent backgrounds with transparent backgrounds
- Replace all cryptocurrency logos with circular/coin-style backgrounds with logos on transparent backgrounds
- Add all country flags supported by NVSTly for forex data
- Add logos for all known cryptocurrency exchanges, including those not integrated with NVSTly
- Start work on light-theme logos (dark versions) to separate from current `stock_icons` that have been aimed for dark-theme (white/light versions). (I.e. `stock_icons_dark` & `stock_icons_light`)
- Include logos for all NYSE & NASDAQ companies

We ask that if you are using this repository, consider contributing missing or transparent logos.

- All files must be in `image/png` format.
- All files should have a lowercase .png extension.
- All files should use an underscore `_` in place of any spaces.
- There is no hard size limitation, but try to keep most images down to a decent size. (under 1mb / under 1024x1024px) - Preferably 250x250 for stocks/crypto logos.

Additionally:

- All stock logos go in `ticker_icons`. Ticker names must be in ALL CAPS.
